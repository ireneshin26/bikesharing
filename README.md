## **Summary**:
Based on the NYC data, the following conclusions can be made as well as next steps:
* Most of the customer base is male so it would be good to have marketing plans to target the male consumer base. 
* More rides are completed during prime work commute hours (weekdays 8-9am and 5-7pm) and prime weekend hours (weekends 10-5pm) so having deals for off-times could help drive more usage. 
* It can also be seen that bikes were used the most near a public transportation hub, which could indicate that users are utilizing public transport and then the bikes to get to their final destination. This may indicate that more bikes will need to be situated near public transport hubs.
* Of the user base, most users were young between 20 - 30 years old. Having marketing plans to target this user base could increase usage.
